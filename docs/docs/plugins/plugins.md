# Supported Plugins

MCDash supports a wide range of plugins, and we're always adding more. If you want to see a plugin added, please open an issue on our [GitHub](https://github.com/gnmyt/MCDash/issues/new)

## Why?

We want to make your experience managing a minecraft server as easy as possible. By hooking directly into your plugins, we can provide you with more information about your server, and allow you to manage it more efficiently.
